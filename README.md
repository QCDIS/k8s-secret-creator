# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Set-up

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate k8s-secret-creator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```shell
python -m k8s_secret_creator
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/k8s-secret-creator/1.0.0/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/k8s-secret-creator/1.0.0/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:

```shell
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
tox
```

## Docker

```shell
docker build . -t k8s-secret-creator
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 k8s-secret-creator:latest
```
